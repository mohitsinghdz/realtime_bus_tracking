# realtime_bus_tracking

The bus transport network of the country faces gridlock on a daily basis, due to this the daily commuter has to faces delays to work and other of his destinations. We have devised a system wherein we use real time tracking  and at a later stage machine learning to provide the user back  his estimated time of arrival at his preferred bus stop and to the desired destination. Every bus in the network gets a unique ID and our device associated with it. Over time after gathering data about routes and delays on the route, we shall be able to train a linear regression model which will be able to pre-empt the outcomes of the input data by virtue of its sampled data. This will be able to provide best possible estimated time of arrival of busses at bus stop and destinations in an hour in advance.
